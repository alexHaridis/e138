Edwards examines how computers became symbolic and practical tools within the national security state, influencing both the conduct of the Cold War and the broader cultural understanding of computing in society. Through a detailed historical analysis, the book reveals how the ideologies of the Cold War were embedded in the development of computing and how these technologies, in turn, shaped political discourse and thought during this period.",

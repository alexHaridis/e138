                    <p><strong>What makes design a unique domain from a computational point of view? Are there different models of computing in design? Can computing  assimilate design values, such as aesthetics or utility?</strong> ES138 is a new course introducing the varied nature and practice of computation in design. Structured in a series of modules, it covers computing models in design such as visual calculating and rule-based generative design, problem-solving, design knowledge representation, and models of learning. Integrates approaches from design theory, art, mathematics, architecture, aesthetics, linguistics, cognitive science, computer science, and artificial intelligence to foster a critical (evaluative) mindset on computing concepts relevant for both thinking about and doing design. Provides an opportunity to develop an independent research oriented project on computation and design.</p>
                    <p>Structured in a series of modules, it covers seeing and pattern recognition, visual calculating and rule-based generative design, models of problem-solving, design knowledge and models of learning. Integrates technical methods and evaluative frameworks from design theory, art, mathematics, architecture, aesthetics, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence to foster a critical (evaluative) mindset on computing concepts relevant for both thinking about and doing design. Aims to build a broad basis on past and present research and scholarship in design and computation to facilitate continuous learning. Provides an opportunity to develop an independent research oriented project on computation and design of relevance to the topics discussed in class.</p>
                    <p>In addition to hands-on class activities and multi-step assignments, the course involves practice in reading and responding to primary and prepared materials that expand on topics introduced in class. You may be asked to understand a reading in terms of its specific content, relate it to the content of other readings and/or apply what you learned to a real-world case.</p>
                    <p><span class="strong">Recommended Background and Prerequisites</span> Students with an interest in any area of design are welcome. There is no formal prerequisite for this course but enrollment is limited. If the course is oversubscribed preference will be given to upper-level undergraduate students who have taken an introductory course combining computation, design, or art (e.g., ES50/51, CS73, CS79) and students pursuing joint concentrations (e.g., computer science, history of art and architecture, engineering, cognitive science). Interested students are required to complete an<a href="https://forms.gle/7di2cRazemUK9X5s9">enrollment application survey</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Enrollment</strong> is limited and students are required to <a href="#">complete an enrollment application</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Graduate students enrolled in a master's or PhD program will be accepted on a limited basis.</p>

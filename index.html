            <p>
                <strong>ENG-SCI S138</strong> is a new course that introduces students to the major computational viewpoints of spatial design, that is, the activity of creating new or evaluating existing spatial objects that are used or experienced by humans.
            </p>

            <p>
                This course focuses on major computational viewpoints of design seen as an activity of creating or evaluating spatial objects used or experienced by humans.
            </p>

            <p>
                Offers technical and hands-on experience with rule-driven and data-driven computational viewpoints, and a critical understanding of their capabilities and limitations for spatial thinking and expression, and for assimilating human-centered value judgements related to aesthetics, utility, or ethics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Takes an interdisciplinary view of computing drawing cases from the built environment, everyday useful objects, functional products, and art and design. Provides opportunities for formal presentation and critique and a final team-based project.  
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="strong">Recommended Background and Prerequisites</span> Students across FAS with an interest in any area of design are welcome. There is no formal prerequisite for this course, but if the course is oversubscribed preference will be given to upper-level undergraduate students who have taken an introductory course combining computation, design, or art (e.g., ES50/51, CS73, CS79) 
            as well as students pursuing joint concentrations (e.g., computer science, history of art and architecture, engineering, cognitive science). Graduate students will be required to complete additional coursework.
            </p>



            <p>
                <strong>Enrollment</strong> is limited and students are required to <a href="#">complete an enrollment application</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Graduate students enrolled in a master's or PhD program will be accepted on a limited basis.
